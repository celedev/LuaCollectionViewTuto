# CollectionViewTuto

CollectionViewTuto is the application created in the [CodeFlow tutorial on celedev.com](https://www.celedev.com/tutorial/). 

CollectionViewTuto is a UICollectionView-based CodeFlow application written entirely in Lua. This 
This application displays the individual words of a text file in a UICollectionView and includes the support for zooming and rotating a word cell.

CollectionViewTuto shows many aspects of the interaction between Lua code and Objective-C in CodeFlow. 
It also illustrates the use of a text resource from the Lua code in CodeFlow.

## Configuration required

A Mac with Celedev CodeFlow version 0.9.15 or later.

An iPhone or iPad, with iOS 8 or later, for running the application (alternatively you can use the Xcode simulator).

## How to use this code sample

1. Open the CodeFlow project for this sample application.  
  This will automatically update the associated Xcode project, so that paths and other build settings are correctly set for your environment.

2. Open the associated Xcode project. You can do this in CodeFlow with the menu command `Program -> Open Xcode Project`.

3. Run the application on a device or in the simulator.

4. In CodeFlow, select the application in the `Target` popup menu in the project window toolbar. The app stops on a breakpoint at the first line of the Lua program.

5. Click on the `Continue` button in the toolbar (or use the CodeFlow debugger for stepping in the program) 

6. Enjoy the power of live coding with CodeFlow

## Troubleshooting

- **Some libraries / header files in the sample app Xcode project are missing**

  **⇒ Fix**: open the corresponding CodeFlow project, and CodeFlow will update the associated Xcode project, so that paths and libraries are correctly set.

- **Link errors (missing symbols) occur when I compile the Xcode project**

  **Most probable cause**: if you are using Xcode 5 (and thus iOS 7.1 SDK), these errors occur because the sample app is configured for the iOS 8 SDK.

  **⇒ Fix**: this application requires iOS 8, so you have to run it only from Xcode 6 or later.
