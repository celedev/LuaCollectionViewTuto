# WordsCollection

Words Collection is a UICollectionView-based CodeFlow tutorial application written entirely in Lua. 
This application displays the individual words of a text file in a UICollectionView and includes the support for zooming and rotating a word cell.

CollectionViewDemo shows many aspects of the interaction between Lua code and Objective-C in CodeFlow. 
It also illustrates the use of a text resource from the Lua code in CodeFlow.

## Configuration required

A Mac with Celedev CodeFlow version 0.98 or later.

An iPhone or iPad, with iOS 8 or later, for running the application (alternatively you can use the Xcode simulator).

## How to use this code sample

1. Open the CodeFlow Program document *WordsCollection.luapp* in **CodeFlow**.
2. Open the associated Xcode project from the CodeFlow *Program* menu (or open the project directly in Xcode) and run the application on a device or in the simulator.
3. In **CodeFlow**, select the device running the application in the `Target` popup menu in the toolbar. The app stops on a breakpoint at the first line of the Lua program.
4. Click on the `Continue` button in the toolbar (or use the **CodeFlow** debugger for stepping in the program) 
5. Enjoy the power of live coding with **CodeFlow**
